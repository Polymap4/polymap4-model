# Model2 - domain specific models in Java

The Model2 System is a toolkit that helps to work with domain specific models in Java, using the standard Java platform, without the use of any pre-processors or new language elements. Everything you know from Java still applies and you can leverage both your experience and toolkits.

This work is heavily inspired by the [Qi4j Framework](http://qi4j.org/)
